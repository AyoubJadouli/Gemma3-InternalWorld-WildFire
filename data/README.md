## About

This dataset, titled "Morocco Wildfire Predictions: 2010-2022 ML Dataset" offers an extensive collection of data tailored for machine learning applications aiming to predict wildfire occurrences in Morocco from 2010 to 2022. It integrates diverse data sources, including meteorological conditions from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) dataset provided by NOAA, wildfire instances from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), human population density figures adjusted from the UN WPP, and environmental factors such as soil moisture and vegetation greenness (NDVI) from NASA GES DISC and ORNL DAAC, respectively.

The dataset has been meticulously prepared to facilitate the development of predictive models that can aid in wildfire management and mitigation efforts. Key features include standardized column names, interpolated missing values, and enriched data points for a comprehensive analysis. Additionally, the dataset is balanced to include equal instances of wildfire and non-wildfire occurrences, and features a variety of indicators such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, NDVI, soil moisture levels, and population density, alongside temporal and spatial data.

This dataset was inspired by the increasing need for advanced predictive models that can provide accurate and timely predictions of wildfire occurrences, leveraging machine learning techniques. It is intended for researchers, data scientists, and policymakers who are focused on environmental protection, disaster management, and the development of AI-driven solutions for predicting and mitigating wildfire risks.
